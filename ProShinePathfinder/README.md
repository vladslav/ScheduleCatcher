##Pathfinder for Proshine v2.0.0
This script provides a module to move from a map A to a map B using the shortest path.  
The Objective of this project is to provide a tool to simplify scripting in proshine. So you don't have to use an elseif per map you're crossing.  
It also provides advanced functionality, settings, and more...  

[For explanation on how to use the API read HOWTO](https://github.com/MeltWS/ProShinePathfinder/blob/master/HOWTO.md).  
[If you want to know how the map system work or how to add maps](https://github.com/MeltWS/ProShinePathfinder/blob/master/ADDINGMAPS.md).  
Use `LoadMe_Test.lua` to test the module, I recommand you [read](https://github.com/MeltWS/ProShinePathfinder/blob/master/LoadMe_Test.lua) it as well.  
You should also read and modify the setting file located in `Settings/Static_Settings.lua` to your needs.

A simple implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm
The `aStar` function expect a few more arguments than most other implementations available anywhere.
I therefore invite you to read `example.lua`
